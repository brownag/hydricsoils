Field Indicators of Hydric Soils in the
United States, Version 8.2, 2018
Introduction
Field Indicators of Hydric Soils in the United States
is a guide to help identify and delineate hydric soils
in the field (fig. 1). Field indicators (indicators) are
not intended to replace or modify the requirements
contained in the definition of a hydric soil. Proper
use of the indicators requires a basic knowledge
of soil-landscape relationships and soil survey
procedures.
The National Technical Committee for Hydric
Soils (NTCHS) defines a hydric soil as a soil that
formed under conditions of saturation, flooding, or
ponding long enough during the growing season
to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part
(Federal Register, 1994). Most hydric soils exhibit
characteristic morphologies that result from repeated
periods of saturation or inundation that last more
than a few days. Saturation or inundation, when
combined with microbial activity in the soil, causes the
2 Field Indicators of
depletion of oxygen. Prolonged anaerobic conditions
promote certain biogeochemical processes, such
as the accumulation of organic matter and the
reduction, translocation, or accumulation of iron
and other reducible elements. These processes
result in distinctive characteristics that persist in the
soil during both wet and dry periods, making them
particularly useful for identifying hydric soils in the
field. The indicators are used to identify the hydric
soil component of wetlands; however, there are
some hydric soils that lack any of the currently listed
indicators. Therefore, the lack of any listed indicator
does not prevent classification of the soil as hydric.
Such soils should be studied and their characteristic
morphologies identified for inclusion in this guide.
The indicators are designed to be regionally
specific. The description of each indicator identifies
the land resource regions (LRRs) and/or major land
resource areas (MLRAs) in which the indicator can be
applied. The geographic extent of LRRs and MLRAs is
defined in U.S. Department of Agriculture Handbook
296 (USDA, NRCS, 2006b). See the map or LRRs
(fig. 6, page 7) and the list of LRR-specific indicators
(Appendices 1 and 2).
The list of indicators is dynamic; changes and
additions are anticipated with new research and field
testing. The section “To Comment on the Indicators”
provides guidance on how to recommend deletions,
additions, and other changes. Any modifications
to the indicators must be approved by NRCS and
the NTCHS. The current version of the indicators is
available on the NRCS hydric soils website (http://
www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/soils/use/
hydric/).
Concept
Hydric soil indicators are formed predominantly by
the accumulation or loss of iron, manganese, sulfur,
or carbon compounds under saturated and anaerobic
conditions. The processes and the soil features that
develop under these conditions are described in the
following paragraphs.
Iron and Manganese Reduction,
Translocation, and Accumulation
In an anaerobic environment, soil microbes reduce
iron from the ferric (Fe3+
) to the ferrous (Fe2+
) form
and manganese from the manganic (Mn4+
) to the
manganous (Mn2+
) form. Of the two, evidence of
iron reduction is more commonly observed in soils.
Areas in the soil where iron is reduced often develop
characteristic bluish gray or greenish gray colors
known as gley (colors with value of 4 or more on the
gley pages in the Munsell color book). Ferric iron is
insoluble, but ferrous iron enters the soil solution,
where it may be moved or translocated to other areas
of the soil. Areas that have lost iron typically develop
characteristic gray or reddish gray colors and are
known as redox depletions. If a soil reverts to an
aerobic state, iron that is in solution will oxidize and
become concentrated in patches as soft masses and
along root channels or other pores. These areas of
oxidized iron are called redox concentrations. Since
water movement in these saturated or inundated
soils can be multidirectional, redox depletions and
concentrations can occur anywhere in the soil and
have irregular shapes and sizes. Soils that are
saturated and contain ferrous iron at the time of
sampling may change color upon exposure to the
air, as ferrous iron is rapidly converted to ferric iron
in the presence of oxygen. Such soils are said to
have a reduced matrix (Vepraskas, 1994). Redox
concentrations, depletions, and reduced matrixes are
collectively referred to as redoximorphic features.
While indicators related to iron or manganese
depletions and/or concentrations are most common
in hydric soils, they cannot form in soils with parent
materials that are low in Fe or Mn content. Soils that
formed in such materials may have low-chroma colors
that are not related to saturation and reduction. Such
soils may have hydric soil morphological features that
formed through accumulation of organic matter.
Sulfate Reduction
Sulfur is one of the last elements to be reduced
by microbes in an anaerobic environment. The
microbes convert sulfate (SO4
2-
) to hydrogen
sulfide gas (H2
S). This conversion results in a very
pronounced “rotten egg” odor in some soils that are
inundated or saturated for long periods. In soils that
are not saturated or inundated, sulfate is not reduced
and there is no rotten egg odor. The presence of
hydrogen sulfide is a strong indicator of a hydric soil,
but this indicator occurs only in very wet portions of
the landscape, in soils that contain sulfur-bearing
compounds.
Organic-Matter Accumulation
Soil microbes use carbon compounds that occur
in organic matter as an energy source. The rate at
which soil microbes use organic carbon, however,
is considerably lower in a saturated and anaerobic
environment than under aerobic conditions. Therefore,
3 Hydric Soils
in saturated soils, partially decomposed organic
matter may accumulate. The result in wetlands is often
the development of thick organic surface horizons,
such as peat or muck, or dark organic-rich mineral
surface layers.
Determining the Texture of Soil Materials
High in Organic Carbon
Soil materials fall into three categories based
upon the organic carbon content: organic soil, mucky
mineral soil, and mineral soil. In lieu of laboratory
data, the following field estimation method can be
used to categorize soil material that is wet or nearly
saturated with water. This method may be inconclusive
with loamy or clayey mineral soils. Gently rub the
wet soil material between forefinger and thumb. If
upon the first or second rub the material feels gritty,
it is mineral soil material. If after the second rub the
material feels greasy, it is either mucky mineral or
organic soil material. Gently rub the material two or
three more times. If after these additional rubs it feels
gritty or plastic, it is mucky mineral soil material; if it
still feels greasy, it is organic soil material.
If the material is organic soil material, a further
division should be made. Organic soil materials are
classified as muck, mucky peat, or peat. Differentiating
criteria are based on the percentage of visible fibers
observable with a hand lens in an undisturbed state
and after rubbing between thumb and fingers 10
times. Muck, mucky peat, and peat correspond to the
textures sapric, hemic, and fibric. If there is a conflict
between unrubbed and rubbed fiber content, rubbed
content is used. Live roots are not considered.
Cautions
A soil that is drained or protected (for instance, by
dikes or levees) meets the definition of a hydric soil if
the upper part formed under anaerobic conditions in
an unaltered state. Drained or protected hydric soils
generally have one or more of the indicators. Not
all areas that have hydric soils qualify as wetlands.
For example, a soil that formed under anaerobic
conditions but no longer has wetland hydrology
or supports hydrophytic vegetation still meets the
definition of a hydric soil. However, the area will not
meet the requirements of a wetland determined by
the three factor approach (presence of hydric soils,
wetland hydrology, and hydrophytic vegetation).
There are hydric soils with morphologies that are
difficult to interpret. These include soils with black,
gray, or red parent material; soils with high pH; soils
high or low in content of organic matter; recently
developed hydric soils; and soils high in iron inputs.
In some cases we do not currently have indicators
to assist in the identification of hydric soils in these
situations. As long as the soil meets the definition of a
hydric soil, the lack of an indicator does not preclude
the soil from being hydric.
The indicators were developed mostly to identify
the boundary of hydric soil areas and generally work
best on the margins. For example, redoximorphic
features are most likely to occur in soils that cycle
between anaerobic (reduced) and aerobic (oxidized)
conditions. In some cases, portions of an area under
near-constant saturation will not display an indicator.
Morphological features of hydric soils indicate that
saturation and anaerobic conditions have existed
under either contemporary or former hydrologic
regimes. Where soil morphology seems inconsistent
with the landscape, vegetation, or observable
hydrology, it may be necessary to obtain the
assistance of an experienced soil or wetland scientist
to determine whether the soil is hydric.
Procedure
Observe and Document the Site
Before making any decision about the presence
or absence of hydric soils, the overall site and how
it interacts with the soil should be considered. The
steps below, while not required to identify a hydric
soil, can help to explain why a hydric soil is or is not
present. Always look at the landscape features of the
immediate site and compare them to the surrounding
areas. Try to contrast the features of wet and dry sites
that are in close proximity. When observing slope
features, look first at the area immediately around
the sampling point. For example, a nearly level bench
or depression at the sampling point may be more
important to the wetness of the site than the overall
landform on which the bench or depression occurs.
Understanding how water moves across the site helps
to clarify the reasons for the presence or absence of
hydric soil indicators.
Observe and Document the Soil
To observe and document a hydric soil, first remove
from the soil surface any woody material larger than
2 cm in cross section that cannot be crushed or
shredded when rubbed. Do not remove the organic
surface layers of the soil, which generally consist of
plant remains in various stages of decomposition. Dig
4 Field Indicators of
a hole and describe the soil profile. In general, the
hole should be dug to the depth needed to document
an indicator or to confirm the absence of indicators.
For most soils, the recommended excavation depth is
approximately 20 inches (50 cm) from the soil surface,
although a shallower soil pit may suffice for some
indicators (e.g., A2, Histic Epipedon). Digging may be
difficult in some areas because of rocks or hardpans.
Use the completed profile description to determine
which hydric soil indicators have been met (USDA,
NRCS, 2006a).
For soils with thick, dark surface layers, deeper
examination may be required when field indicators are
not observed at a depth of ≤20 inches (50 cm) from
the soil surface. The accumulation of organic matter
in these soils may mask redoximorphic features in the
surface layers. Examination to a depth of 40 inches (1
m) or more may be needed to determine whether the
soils meet the requirements of indicator A12 (Thick
Dark Surface). A soil auger or probe may be useful for
sampling soil materials below a depth of 20 inches.
Whenever possible, excavate the soil deep enough
to determine if there are layers or materials present
that might restrict soil drainage. This determination
will help to indicate why the soil may or may not
be hydric. After a sufficient number of exploratory
excavations have been made to determine the soil
hydrologic relationships at the site, subsequent
excavations can be limited to the depth needed
to identify hydric soil indicators. Consider taking
photographs of both the soil and the overall site,
including a clearly marked measurement scale in
pictures of soil profiles.
In LRRs R, W, X, and Y, start observations at the
actual surface for indicators A1, A2, and A3; start
observations at the muck or mineral surface for A11
and A12 and for testing indicators that allow muck;
and start observations at the mineral surface for
all other indicators. In LRRs F, G, H, and M, start
observations at the actual soil surface if the soil is
sandy or when applying indicators A1, A2, and A3
and at the muck or mineral surface for the remaining
field indicators. In the remaining LRRs, start
observations at the top of the muck or mineral surface
(underneath any peat and/or mucky peat material),
except for areas of indicators A1, A2, and A3, where
observations begin at the actual soil surface (fig. 2 ).
All colors noted in this guide refer to moist
Munsell colors (X-Rite, 2009). Dry soils should be
moistened until the color no longer changes, and wet
soils should be allowed to dry until they no longer
glisten (fig. 3). Care should be taken to avoid over-
moistening dry soil.
Soil chromas specified in the indicators do not
have decimal points; however, intermediate colors
do occur. Colors should not be rounded to make the
chroma meet the requirements of an indicator. A
soil matrix with chroma between 2 and 3 should be
described as having chroma of 2+. It does not have
chroma of 2 and would not meet the requirements
of any indicator that requires chroma of 2 or less.
Value should be rounded to the nearest color chip
when using the indicators. For example, a color in
between a value of 3 and 4 should be rounded and
not excluded from meeting either F3 Depleted Matrix
or F6 Redox Dark Surface because the color occurs
5
Hydric Soils between color chips. If the value is closer to 3, then
F6 or some other dark surface indicator should be
considered. If it is closer to 4, then F3 or some other
depleted matrix indicator should be considered.
Always examine soil matrix colors in the field
immediately after sampling. Ferrous iron in the soil
can oxidize rapidly, resulting in the development of
colors with higher chroma or redder hue. Soils that are
saturated at the time of sampling may contain reduced
iron and/or manganese that cannot be detected by the
eye. Under saturated conditions, redox concentrations
may be absent or difficult to see, particularly in dark
colored soils. It may be necessary to let the soil dry
(for 5 to 30 minutes or more) to a moist state before
the iron or manganese oxidize and the redoximorphic
features become visible.
Pay particular attention to changes in
microtopography over short distances. Small changes
in elevation may result in repetitive sequences of
hydric/nonhydric soil mosaics, making the delineation
of individual areas of hydric and nonhydric soils
difficult. Commonly, the dominant condition (hydric
or nonhydric) is the only reliable interpretation. The
shape of the local landform can greatly affect the
movement of water through the landscape. Significant
changes in parent material or lithologic discontinuities
in the soil can also affect the hydrologic properties of
the soil.
General Guidance for Using the
Indicators
Many of the hydric soil indicators were developed
specifically for purposes of wetland delineation.
During the development of these indicators, soils in
the interiors of wetlands were not always examined;
therefore, there are wetlands that lack any of the
approved hydric soil indicators in the wettest interior
portions. Wetland delineators and other users of
the hydric soil indicators should concentrate their
sampling efforts near the wetland edge and, if these
soils are hydric, assume that soils in the wetter,
interior portions of the wetland also are hydric, even if
they lack an indicator.
All mineral layers above any layers meeting the
requirements of any indicator(s), except for indicators
A16, S6, S11, F8, F12, F19, F20, and F21, have a
dominant chroma of 2 or less; or the thickness of the
layer(s) with a dominant chroma of more than 2 is less
than 15 cm (6 inches). See figure 4.
Soil Texture and the indicators
Hydric soil indicators occur in three groups.
Indicators for “All Soils” are used for any soil
regardless of texture (A indicators). Indicators for
“Sandy Soils” are used for soil layers with USDA
textures of loamy fine sand or coarser (S indicators).
Indicators for “Loamy and Clayey Soils” are used
6 Field Indicators of
for soil layers of loamy very fine sand and finer (F
indicators). Both Sandy layers and Loamy or Clayey
layers can occur in the same soil profile. Therefore, a
soil that has a loamy surface layer over sand is hydric
if it meets all of the requirements of matrix color,
amount and contrast of redox concentrations, depth,
and thickness for any single indicator or combination
of indicators.
It is permissible to combine certain hydric soil
indicators if all requirements of the indicators are met
except for thickness. The most restrictive requirements
for thickness of layers in any indicators used must
be met. Not all indicators are possible candidates
for combination. For example, indicator F2 (Loamy
Gleyed Matrix) has no thickness requirement and is
not a candidate for combination.
To Comment on the Indicators
The indicators are revised and updated as field
data are collected to improve our understanding of
hydric soil processes. Revisions, additions, and other
comments regarding field observations of hydric
soil conditions that cannot be documented using
the presently recognized hydric soil indicators are
welcome. Any additions or other modifications must
be approved by the NTCHS. Guidelines for requesting
changes to field indicators are as follows:
1. Adding indicators or changing existing
indicators: Minimally, the following should
accompany all requests for additions and changes
to existing hydric soil indicators in Field Indicators of
Hydric Soils in the United States:
a) Detailed descriptions of at least three pedons
that document the addition or change and
detailed descriptions of the neighboring
nonhydric pedons.
b) Detailed vegetative data collected to represent
the vegetation of the six pedons.
c) Saturation/inundation data and oxidation-
reduction potential (Eh) data for a duration that
captures the saturation cycle (dry-wet-dry) of at
least one of the hydric pedons and one of the
nonhydric pedons. Precipitation and in-situ soil-
water pH data from the same sites should also
be provided (fig. 5). Data are to be collected
according to “The Hydric Soil Technical
Standard” described in Hydric Soils Technical
Note 11 (http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/
nrcs/main/soils/use/hydric/).
2. Adding or deleting a test indicator: Minimally,
the following should accompany all requests for

that document the test indicator and detailed
descriptions of three neighboring nonhydric
pedons.
b) Detailed vegetative data collected to represent
the vegetation of the six pedons.
3. All requests involving 1 and 2 above require a
short written plan that: a) identifies the problem, b)
explains the rationale for the request, and c) provides
the following—person responsible and point of contact
(email and postal addresses and phone number),

Field Indicators of Hydric Soils
The indicator descriptions in this section are
structured as follows:
1. Alpha-numeric listing (A, S, or F indicators)
2. Short name
3. Applicable land resource regions (LRRs)
4. Description of the field indicator
5. User notes
For example, A2 is the alpha numeric listing for
the second indicator for All Soils; Histic Epipedon is
the short name; “For use in all LRRs” indicates the
applicable LRRs; and “a histic epipedon underlain by
mineral soil material with chroma of 2 or less” is the
description. The helpful user notes follow the indicator.
All Soils
“All Soils” refers to soils with any USDA soil texture.
All mineral layers above any of the layers meeting
the requirements of any A indicator(s), except for
indicator A16, have a dominant chroma of 2 or less, or
the thickness of the layer(s) with a dominant chroma
of more than 2 is less than 15 cm (6 inches). In
addition, nodules and concretions are not considered
to be redox concentrations for the application of the
indicators. Use the following A-indicators in all soil
layers, regardless of texture.
A1.—Histosol (for use in all LRRs) or Histel (for
use in LRRs with permafrost). Classifies as a Histosol
(except Folist) or as a Histel (except Folistel).
User Notes: In a Histosol, typically 40 cm (16
inches) or more of the upper 80 cm (32 inches) is
organic soil material (fig. 7). Organic soil materials
have organic carbon contents (by weight) of 12 to
18 percent or more, depending on the clay content
of the soil. These materials include muck (sapric soil
material), mucky peat (hemic soil material), and peat
(fibric soil material). See Keys to Soil Taxonomy (Soil
Survey Staff, 2014) for a complete definition.
A2.—Histic Epipedon. For use in all LRRs. A
histic epipedon underlain by mineral soil material with
chroma of 2 or less.
User Notes: Most histic epipedons are surface
horizons 20 cm (8 inches) or more thick of organic soil
material (fig. 8). Aquic conditions or artificial drainage
is required. See Keys to Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey
Staff, 2014) for a complete definition.
A3.—Black Histic. For use in all LRRs. A layer of
peat, mucky peat, or muck 20 cm (8 inches) or more
thick that starts at a depth of ≤15 cm (6 inches) from
the soil surface; has hue of 10YR or yellower, value of
3 or less, and chroma of 1 or less; and is underlain by
mineral soil material with chroma of 2 or less.
10 Field Indicators of
User Notes: Unlike indicator A2, this indicator
does not require proof of aquic conditions or artificial
drainage (fig. 8).
A4.—Hydrogen Sulfide. For use in all LRRs. A
hydrogen sulfide odor starting at a depth ≤30 cm (12
inches) from the soil surface.
User Notes: This “rotten egg smell” indicates that
sulfate-sulfur has been reduced to hydrogen sulfide
gas and therefore the soil is anaerobic (fig. 9).
A5.—Stratified Layers. For use in LRRs C, F, K,
L, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, and U; for testing in LRRs Q, V
and Z. Several stratified layers starting at a depth ≤15
cm (6 inches) from the soil surface. At least one of the
layers has value of 3 or less and chroma of 1 or less,
or it is muck, mucky peat, peat, or a mucky modified
mineral texture. The remaining layers have chroma of
2 or less. For any sandy material that constitutes the
layer with value of 3 or less and chroma of 1 or less,
at least 70 percent of the visible soil particles must be
masked with organic material, viewed through a 10x
or 15x hand lens. Observed without a hand lens, the
particles appear to be close to 100 percent masked.
User Notes: Use of this indicator may require
assistance from a trained soil scientist with local
experience. A stratified layer is depositional and not
pedogenic. The minimum organic-carbon content of
at least one layer of this indicator is slightly less than
is required for indicator A7 (5 cm Mucky Mineral). An
undisturbed sample must be observed. Individual
11
strata are dominantly less than 2.5 cm (1 inch)
thick. A hand lens is an excellent tool to aid in the
identification of this indicator. Many alluvial soils have
stratified layers at greater depths; these soils do not
meet the requirements of this indicator. Many alluvial
soils have stratified layers at the required depths but
do not have chroma of 2 or less; these do not meet
the requirements of this indicator. The stratified layers
occur in any soil texture (fig. 10).
A6.—Organic Bodies. For use in LRRs P (except
for MLRA 136), T, U, and Z. Presence of 2 percent
or more organic bodies of muck or a mucky modified
mineral texture starting at a depth ≤15 cm (6 inches)
from the soil surface.
User Notes: Organic bodies typically occur at the
tips of fine roots. In order to meet the Organic Bodies
indicator, the organic carbon content in organic
bodies must meet the requirements of muck or mucky
modified textures. The size of the organic body is not
specifically defined, but the bodies are commonly
1 to 3 cm (0.5 to 1 inch) in diameter (figs. 11 and
12). Many organic bodies do not have the required
content of organic carbon and as a result do not meet
this indicator. For example, organic bodies of mucky
peat (hemic material) and/or peat (fibric material)
do not meet the requirements of this indicator, nor
does material consisting of partially decomposed
root tissue. The Organic Bodies indicator includes the
indicator previously named “accretions” (Florida Soil
Survey Staff, 1992).
A7.—5 cm Mucky Mineral. For use in LRRs P
(except for MLRA 136), T, U, and Z. A layer of mucky
modified mineral soil material 5 cm (2 inches) or more
12 Field Indicators of
thick, starting at a depth ≤15 cm (6 inches) from the
soil surface (fig. 13).
User Notes: “Mucky” is a USDA texture modifier
for mineral soils. The content of organic carbon is at
least 5 percent and ranges to as high as 18 percent.
The percentage required depends on the clay content
of the soil; the higher the clay content, the higher
the content of organic carbon required. For example,
a mucky fine sand soil contains between 5 and 12
percent organic carbon. When the amount of clay
is increased as in a mucky sandy loam, the organic
carbon content increases to between 7 and 14
percent.
A8.—Muck Presence. For use in LRRs Q, U, V,
and Z. A layer of muck with value of 3 or less and
chroma of 1 or less, starting at a depth ≤15 cm (6
inches) from the soil surface.
User Notes: The presence of muck of any
thickness at a depth of ≤15 cm (6 inches) is the only
requirement. Normally, this expression of anaerobiosis
is at the soil surface; however, it may occur at any
depth ≤15 cm (6 inches). Muck is sapric soil material
with a minimum content of organic carbon that ranges
from12 to18 percent, depending on the content of clay.
Organic soil material is called muck if virtually all of
the material has undergone sufficient decomposition
to prevent the identification of plant parts. Mucky peat
(hemic material) and/or peat (fibric material) do not
qualify. Generally, muck is black and has a “greasy”
feel; sand grains should not be evident.
A9.—1 cm Muck. For use in LRRs D, F, G, H, P
(except for MLRA 136), and T; for testing in LRRs C,
I, J, and O. A layer of muck 1 cm (0.5 inch) or more
thick with value of 3 or less and chroma of 1 or less
and starting at a depth ≤15 cm (6 inches) from the soil
surface.
User Notes: Unlike indicator A8 (Muck Presence),
this indicator has a minimum thickness requirement
of 1 cm (fig. 14). Normally, this expression of
anaerobiosis is at the soil surface; however, it may
occur at any depth ≤15 cm (6 inches). Muck is sapric
soil material with a minimum content of organic
carbon that ranges from12 to18 percent, depending
on the content of clay. Organic soil material is called
muck if virtually all of the material has undergone
sufficient decomposition to limit the recognition of
plant parts. Mucky peat (hemic material) and/or peat
(fibric material) do not qualify. Generally, muck is black
and has a “greasy” feel; sand grains should not be
evident.
A10.—2 cm Muck. For use in LRR M and N;
for testing in LRRs A, B, E, K, L, and S (except for
MLRA 148). A layer of muck 2 cm (0.75 inch) or more
thick with value of 3 or less and chroma of 1 or less,
starting at a depth ≤15 cm (6 inches) from the soil
surface.
User Notes: This indicator requires a minimum
muck thickness of 2 cm. Normally, this expression of
anaerobiosis is at the soil surface; however, it may
occur at any depth ≤15 cm (6 inches). Muck is sapric
soil material with a minimum content of organic
carbon that ranges from12 to18 percent, depending
on the content of clay. Organic soil material is called
muck if virtually all of the material has undergone
sufficient decomposition to limit the recognition of
plant parts. Mucky peat (hemic material) and/or peat
13 Hydric Soils
(fibric material) do not qualify. Generally, muck is black
and has a “greasy” feel; sand grains should not be
evident.
A11.—Depleted Below Dark Surface. For use in
all LRRs, except for W, X, and Y; for testing in LRRs
W, X, and Y. A layer with a depleted or gleyed matrix
that has 60 percent or more chroma of 2 or less,
starting at a depth ≤30 cm (12 inches) from the soil
surface, and having a minimum thickness of either:
a. 15 cm (6 inches), or
b. 5 cm (2 inches) if the 5 cm consists of
fragmental soil material.
Organic, loamy, or clayey layer(s) above the
depleted or gleyed matrix must have value of 3 or
less and chroma of 2 or less starting at a depth <15
cm (6 inches) from the soil surface and extend to the
depleted or gleyed matrix. Any sandy material above
the depleted or gleyed matrix must have value of 3
or less and chroma of 1 or less starting at a depth
≤15 cm (6 inches) from the soil surface and extend to
the depleted or gleyed matrix. Viewed through a 10x
or 15x hand lens, at least 70 percent of the visible
sand particles must be masked with organic material.
Observed without a hand lens, the sand particles
appear to be close to 100 percent masked.
User Notes: This indicator often occurs in Mollisols
but also applies to soils with umbric epipedons and
dark colored ochric epipedons (figs. 15 and 16). For
soils with dark colored epipedons more than 30 cm
(12 inches) thick, use indicator A12. A depleted matrix
requires value of 4 or more and chroma of 2 or less.
Redox concentrations, including soft iron-manganese
masses and/or pore linings, are required in soils
14 Field Indicators of
with matrix colors of 4/1, 4/2, or 5/2. A, E, and calcic
horizons may have low chromas and high values
and may therefore be mistaken for a depleted matrix;
however, they are excluded from the concept of
depleted matrix unless the soil has common or many
distinct or prominent redox concentrations occurring
as soft masses or pore linings.
A12.—Thick Dark Surface. For use in all LRRs.
A layer at least 15 cm (6 inches) thick with a depleted
or gleyed matrix that has 60 percent or more chroma
of 2 or less starting below 30 cm (12 inches) of the
surface. The layer(s) above the depleted or gleyed
matrix and starting at a depth <15 cm (6 inches) from
the soil surface must have value of 2.5 or less and
chroma of 1 or less to a depth of at least 30 cm (12
inches) and value of 3 or less and chroma of 1 or less
in any remaining layers above the depleted or gleyed
matrix. In any sandy material above the depleted
or gleyed matrix, at least 70 percent of the visible
soil particles must be masked with organic material,
viewed through a 10x or 15x hand lens. Observed
without a hand lens, the particles appear to be close
to 100 percent masked.
User Notes: This indicator applies to soils that
have a black layer 30 cm (12 inches) or more thick
and have value of 3 or less and chroma of 1 or less
in any remaining layers directly above a depleted or
gleyed matrix (fig. 17). This indicator is most often
associated with overthickened soils in concave
landscape positions. A depleted matrix requires
value of 4 or more and chroma of 2 or less. Redox
concentrations, including soft iron-manganese
15 Hydric Soils
masses and/or pore linings, are required in soils
with matrix colors of 4/1, 4/2, or 5/2. A, E, and calcic
horizons may have low chromas and high values
and may therefore be mistaken for a depleted matrix;
however, they are excluded from the concept of
depleted matrix unless the soil has common or many
distinct or prominent redox concentrations occurring
as soft masses or pore linings.
A13.—Alaska Gleyed. For use in LRRs W, X, and
Y. A mineral layer with a dominant hue of N, 10Y,
5GY, 10GY, 5G, 10G, 5BG, 10BG, 5B, 10B, or 5PB
and with value of 4 or more in more than 50 percent
of the matrix. The layer starts at a depth ≤30 cm (12
inches) from the mineral surface and is underlain at a
depth ≤1.5 m (60 inches) from the soil surface by soil
material with hue of 5Y or redder in the same type of
parent material.
User Notes: This indicator can be used for all
mineral soils, not just sandy soils. The indicator has
two requirements (fig. 18). First, one or more of the
specified gley colors occurs ≤30 cm (12 inches) from
the soil surface. These must be the colors on the
pages of the Munsell color book (X-Rite, 2009) that
show gley colors, not simply gray colors. Second,
below these gley colors, the color of similar soil
material is 5Y or redder (2.5Y, 10YR, 7.5YR, etc.).
The presence of the truly gley colors indicates that
the soil has undergone reduction. The requirement
for 5Y or redder colors lower in the profile ensures
that the gley colors are not simply the basic color
of the parent material. Tidal sediments, lacustrine
sediments, loess, and some glacial tills have base
colors that appear as gley. This indicator proves
that the near-surface gley colors are not natural soil
material colors and that they are the result of reduced
conditions. When comparing the near-surface and
underlying colors, make sure that both are the same
type of soil material. Many soils in Alaska consist
of two or more types of material (e.g., silty loess
overlying gravelly glacial till or sand and gravel river
deposits).
A14.—Alaska Redox. For use in LRRs W, X,
and Y. A mineral layer that has dominant hue of 5Y
with chroma of 3 or less, or a gleyed matrix, with
10 percent or more distinct or prominent redox
concentrations occurring as pore linings with value
and chroma of 4 or more. The layer occurs at a depth
≤30 cm (12 inches) from the soil surface.
User Notes: In a soil layer that has been
reduced, one of the first areas where oxygen will be
reintroduced is along pores and the channels of live
roots (fig. 19). As oxidation occurs in these areas,
characteristic reddish orange redox concentrations
(with value and chroma of 4 or more) will be apparent
along the pores and linings. These will stand out in
contrast to the matrix color of the overall soil layer.
First, determine if the dominant color(s) of the soil
layer match the chroma 3 or less or gley colors
indicated. Then break open pieces of the soil and
look for reddish orange redox concentrations along
pores and root linings. The occurrence of these
concentrations indicates that the soil has been
reduced during periods of saturation and is now
oxidizing in a drier state.
A15.—Alaska Gleyed Pores. For use in LRRs W,
X, and Y. A mineral layer that has 10 percent or more
hue of N, 10Y, 5GY, 10GY, 5G, 10G, 5BG, 10BG,
5B, 10B, or 5PB with value of 4 or more along root
channels or other pores and that starts at a depth ≤30
cm (12 inches) from the soil surface. The matrix has a
dominant hue of 5Y or redder.
16 Field Indicators of
User Notes: In a soil layer that is becoming
anaerobic, reduced conditions will first occur where
the soil microbes have an ample supply of organic
carbon. Colder soils, such as those in Alaska,
normally have a low content of organic carbon, so
the microbes will congregate along the channels
containing dead roots. Gley colors will first appear
along these channels (fig. 20). In a soil layer that is not
already dominated by gley colors, break open pieces
of the soil and look closely at the root channels.
Many of these will be very thin or fine. See if you can
observe thin coatings along the channels that match
the gley colors listed in the indicator. If they occur,
they indicate that the soil experiences anaerobic
conditions.
A16.—Coast Prairie Redox. For use in MLRA
150A of LRR T; for testing in LRR S (except for
MLRA 149B). A layer starting at a depth ≤15 cm (6
inches) from the soil surface that is at least 10 cm (4
inches) thick and has a matrix chroma of 3 or less
with 2 percent or more distinct or prominent redox
concentrations occurring as soft masses and/or pore
linings.
User Notes: These hydric soils occur mainly
on depressional landforms and portions of the
intermound landforms on the Lissie Formation. Redox
concentrations occur mainly as iron-dominated pore
linings. Common or many redox concentrations are
required. Matrix colors with chroma 3 are allowed
because they may be the color of stripped sand grains
or because few or common sand-sized reddish chert
particles occur and may prevent obtaining chroma of
2 or less.
A17.—Mesic Spodic. For use in MLRA 144A and
145 of LRR R and in MLRA 149B of LRR S. A layer
that is ≥5 cm (2 inches) thick, that starts at a depth
≤15 cm (6 inches) from the mineral soil surface, that
has value of 3 or less and chroma of 2 or less, and
that is directly underlain by either:
a. One or more layers of spodic materials that
have a combined thickness of ≥8 cm (3 inches),
that start at a depth ≤30 cm (12 inches) from
the mineral soil surface, and that have a value
and chroma of 3 or less; or
b. One or more layers that have a combined
thickness of ≥5 cm (2 inches), that start at a
depth ≤30 cm (12 inches) from the mineral
soil surface, that have a value of 4 or more
and chroma of 2 or less, and that are directly
underlain by one or more layers that have a
17 Hydric Soils
combined thickness of ≥8 cm (3 inches), that
are spodic materials, and that have a value and
chroma of 3 or less.
User Notes: This indicator is used to identify wet
soils that have spodic materials or that meet the
definition of Spodosols. The layer or layers described
above that have value of 4 or more and chroma of 2 or
less are typically described as E or Eg horizons. The
layer or layers that are 8 cm (3 inches) or more, that
have value and chroma 3 or less, and that meet the
definition of spodic materials (that is, have an illuvial
accumulation of amorphous materials consisting of
organic carbon and aluminum with or without Fe) are
typically described as Bh, Bhs, or Bhsm horizons.
These Bh, Bhs, or Bhsm horizons typically have
several color patterns, cementation, or both.
Sandy Soils
“Sandy Soils” have a USDA texture of loamy fine
sand and coarser. All mineral layers above any of the
layers meeting the requirements of any S indicator(s),
except for indicator S6 and S11, have a dominant
chroma of 2 or less, or the thickness of the layer(s) with
a dominant chroma of more than 2 is less than 15 cm
(6 inches). In addition, nodules and concretions are
not considered to be redox concentrations. Use the
following S-indicators for sandy mineral soil materials.
S1.—Sandy Mucky Mineral. For use in all LRRs,
except for T, U, W, X, Y , and Z and portions of LRR
P outside of MLRA 136. A layer of mucky modified
sandy soil material 5 cm (2 inches) or more thick
starting at a depth ≤15 cm (6 inches) from the soil
surface.
User Notes: “Mucky” is a USDA texture modifier
for mineral soils. The content of organic carbon is at
least 5 percent and ranges to as high as 14 percent
for sandy soils. The percent required depends on the
clay content of the soil; the higher the clay content,
the higher the content of organic carbon required. For
example, a mucky fine sandy soil contains between 5
and 12 percent organic carbon.
S2.—2.5 cm Mucky Peat or Peat. For use in LRRs
G and H. A layer of mucky peat or peat 2.5 cm (1
inch) or more thick with value of 4 or less and chroma
of 3 or less, starting at a depth ≤15 cm (6 inches)
from the soil surface, and underlain by sandy soil
material.
User Notes: Mucky peat (hemic soil material) and
peat (fibric soil material) have a minimum organic
carbon content of 12 to 18 percent, depending on the
content of clay. Organic soil material is called peat if
virtually all of the plant remains are sufficiently intact
to permit identification of plant remains. Mucky peat
is at an intermediate stage of decomposition between
peat and highly decomposed muck. To ascertain if
mucky peat and/or peat are present, determine the
percentage of rubbed fibers.
S3.—5 cm Mucky Peat or Peat. For use in LRRs
F and M; for testing in LRRs K, L, and R. A layer of
mucky peat or peat 5 cm (2 inches) or more thick with
value of 3 or less and chroma of 2 or less, starting at
a depth ≤15 cm (6 inches) from the soil surface, and
underlain by sandy soil material.
User Notes: Mucky peat (hemic soil material) and
peat (fibric soil material) have a minimum organic
carbon content of 12 to 18 percent, depending on the
content of clay. Organic soil material is called peat if
virtually all of the plant remains are sufficiently intact
to permit identification of plant remains. Mucky peat
is at an intermediate stage of decomposition between
peat and highly decomposed muck. To ascertain if
mucky peat and/or peat are present, determine the
percentage of rubbed fibers.
S4.—Sandy Gleyed Matrix. For use in all LRRs,
except for W, X, and Y. A gleyed matrix that occupies
60 percent or more of a layer starting at a depth ≤15
cm (6 inches) from the soil surface.
User Notes: Gley colors are not synonymous with
gray colors (fig. 21). They are the colors on the gley
color pages in the Munsell color book (X-Rite, 2009)
that have hue of N, 10Y, 5GY, 10GY, 5G, 10G, 5BG,
10BG, 5B, 10B, or 5PB and value of 4 or more. For
this indicator, the gleyed matrix only has to be present
at a depth ≤15 cm (6 inches) from the surface. Soils
with gleyed matrices are saturated for periods of a
significant duration; as a result, there is no thickness
requirement for the layer.
S5.—Sandy Redox. For use in all LRRs, except for
Q, V, W, X, and Y. A layer starting at a depth ≤15 cm (6
inches) from the soil surface that is at least 10 cm (4
inches) thick and has a matrix with 60 percent or more
chroma of 2 or less and 2 percent or more distinct
or prominent redox concentrations occurring as soft
masses and/or pore linings.
User Notes: “Distinct” and “prominent” are defined
in the Glossary. Redox concentrations include iron
and manganese masses (reddish mottles) and pore
linings (Vepraskas, 1994). Included within the concept
18 Field Indicators of
of redox concentrations are iron-manganese bodies
occurring as soft masses with diffuse boundaries.
Common (2 to less than 20 percent) or many (20
percent or more) redox concentrations are required
(USDA, NRCS, 2002). If the soil is saturated at the
time of sampling, it may be necessary to let it dry to
a moist condition for redox features to become visible
(figs. 22 and 23). This is a very common indicator of
hydric soils and is often used to identify the hydric/
nonhydric soil boundary in sandy soils.
S6.—Stripped Matrix. For use in all LRRs, except
for V, W, X, and Y. A layer starting at a depth ≤15
cm (6 inches) from the soil surface in which iron-
manganese oxides and/or organic matter have been
stripped from the matrix and the primary base color
of the soil material has been exposed. The stripped
areas and translocated oxides and/or organic matter
form a faintly contrasting pattern of two or more colors
with diffuse boundaries. The stripped zones are 10
percent or more of the volume and are rounded.
User Notes: This indicator includes the indicator
previously named “polychromatic matrix” as well as the
term “streaking.” Common or many areas of stripped
(unmasked) soil materials are required. The stripped
areas are typically 1 to 3 cm (0.5 to 1 inch) in size
19 Hydric Soils
but may be larger or smaller (fig. 24). Commonly, the
stripped areas have value of 5 or more and chroma
of 2 or less, and the unstripped areas have chroma
of 3 and/or 4. The matrix (predominant color) may
not have the material with chroma of 3 and/or 4. The
mobilization and translocation of oxides and/or organic
matter is the important process and should result in a
splotchy pattern of masked and unmasked soil areas.
This may be a difficult pattern to recognize and is more
evident when a horizontal slice is observed.
S7.—Dark Surface. For use in LRRs K, L, M, N,
P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, and Z. A layer 10 cm (4 inches)
thick, starting at a depth less than or equal to the
upper 15 cm (6 inches) from the soil surface, with a
matrix value 3 or less and chroma 1 or less. At least
70 percent of the visible soil particles must be masked
with organic material, viewed through a 10x or 15x
hand lens. Observed without a hand lens, the particles
appear to be close to 100 percent masked. The matrix
color of the layer directly below the dark layer must
have the same colors as those described above or
any color that has chroma of 2 or less.
User Notes: An undisturbed sample must be
observed (fig. 25). Many wet soils have a ratio of
about 50 percent soil particles that are masked with
organic matter and about 50 percent unmasked
soil particles, giving the soils a salt-and-pepper
appearance. Where the coverage is less than 70
percent, the Dark Surface indicator does not occur.
S8.—Polyvalue Below Surface. For use in LRRs
R, S, T, and U; for testing in LRRs K and L. A layer
with value of 3 or less and chroma of 1 or less starting
at a depth ≤15 cm (6 inches) from the soil surface. At
least 70 percent of the visible soil particles must be
masked with organic material, viewed through a 10x
or 15x hand lens. Observed without a hand lens, the
particles appear to be close to 100 percent masked.
Directly below this layer, 5 percent or more of the soil
volume has value of 3 or less and chroma of 1 or less,
and the remainder of the soil volume has value of 4 or
more and chroma of 1 or less to a depth of 30 cm (12
inches) or to the spodic horizon, whichever is less.
User Notes: This indicator applies to soils with
a very dark gray or black surface or near-surface
layer that is less than 10 cm (4 inches) thick and
is underlain by a layer in which organic matter has
been differentially distributed within the soils by water
movement (fig. 26). The mobilization and translocation
of organic matter result in splotchy coated and
uncoated soil.
20 Field Indicators of
S9.—Thin Dark Surface. For use in LRRs R, S,
T, and U; for testing in LRRs K and L. A layer 5 cm (2
inches) or more thick, starting at a depth ≤15 cm (6
inches) from the soil surface, with value of 3 or less
and chroma of 1 or less. At least 70 percent of the
visible soil particles must be masked with organic
material, viewed through a 10x or 15x hand lens.
Observed without a hand lens, the particles appear
to be close to 100 percent masked. This layer is
underlain by a layer or layers with value of 4 or less
and chroma of 1 or less to a depth of 30 cm (12
inches) or to the spodic horizon, whichever is less.
User Notes: This indicator applies to soils with
a very dark gray or black near-surface layer that is
at least 5 cm (2 inches) thick and is underlain by
a layer in which organic matter has been carried
downward by flowing water (fig. 27). The mobilization
and translocation of organic matter result in an even
distribution of organic matter in the eluvial (E) horizon.
The chroma of 1 or less is critical because it limits
application of this indicator to only those soils that are
depleted of iron. This indicator commonly occurs in
hydric Spodosols, but a spodic horizon is not required.
S11.—High Chroma Sands. For use along
shorelines and near shore regions of the Great Lakes
in LRRs K and L. In coastal zones and dune-and-
swale complexes, a layer 5 cm (2 inches) or more
thick starting at a depth ≤10 cm (4 inches) from the
soil surface with chroma 4 or less and 2% or more
distinct or prominent redox concentrations.
User Notes: Along the shorelines of the Great
Lakes within LRRs L and K, some wetlands exhibit
the presence of high chroma sands (often a chroma
21 Hydric Soils
3 to 4). These high-chroma, sandy soils occur at the
landward edge of coastal marshes or in interdunal
landscape positions of dune-and-swale complexes.
These soils exhibit redox concentrations as pore
linings and/or soft masses starting at a depth ≤10 cm
(4 inches) from the soil surface. In adjacent upland
areas, redox concentrations are absent or are only
observed below 15 cm (6 inches). It may be helpful
to involve a soil scientist to identify those soils that
qualify for this indicator.
S12.—Barrier Islands 1 cm Muck. For use in
MLRA 153B and 153D of LRR T. In the swale portion
of dune-and-swale complexes of barrier islands, a
layer of muck 1 cm (0.5 inch) or more thick with value
of 3 or less and chroma of 2 or less and starting at a
depth ≤15 cm (6 inches) from the soil surface.
User Notes: This indicator is similar to A9 but
allows chroma of greater than 1, but not greater
than 2. The indicator is limited to dune-and-swale
complexes on barrier islands.
Loamy and Clayey Soils
“Loamy and Clayey Soils” have USDA textures
of loamy very fine sand and finer. All mineral layers
above any of the layers meeting the requirements
of any F-indicator(s), except for indicators F8, F12,
F19, F20, and F21, have a dominant chroma of 2 or
less, or the thickness of the layer(s) with a dominant
chroma of more than 2 is less than 15 cm (6 inches).
(See figure 4.) Also, except for indicator F16, nodules
and concretions are not considered to be redox
concentrations. Use the following F-indicators for
loamy or clayey mineral soil materials.
F1.—Loamy Mucky Mineral. For use in all LRRs,
except for N, Q, R, S, V, W, X, and Y, those using A7
(LRRs P, T, U, and Z), and MLRA 1 of LRR A. A layer
of mucky modified loamy or clayey soil material 10 cm
(4 inches) or more thick starting at a depth ≤15 cm (6
inches) from the soil surface.
User Notes: “Mucky” is a USDA texture modifier for
mineral soils. The content of organic carbon is at least
8 percent but can range to as high as 18 percent. The
percentage required depends on the clay content of
the soil; the higher the clay content, the higher the
content of organic carbon required. For example,
mucky sandy loam requires between 8 and 14 percent
organic carbon.
F2.—Loamy Gleyed Matrix. For use in all LRRs,
except for W, X, and Y. A gleyed matrix that occupies
60 percent or more of a layer starting at a depth ≤30
cm (12 inches) from the soil surface (fig. 28).
User Notes: Gley colors are not synonymous
with gray colors. They are the colors on the gley
color pages of the Munsell color book (Xrite, 2006)
that have hue of N, 10Y, 5GY, 10GY, 5G, 10G, 5BG,
10BG, 5B, 10B, or 5PB and value of 4 or more. The
gleyed matrix only has to be present at a depth ≤30
cm (12 inches) from the surface. Soils with gleyed
matrices are saturated for periods of a significant
duration; as a result, there is no thickness requirement
for the layer.
F3.—Depleted Matrix. For use in all LRRs, except
W, X, and Y; for testing in LRRs W, X, and Y. A layer
that has a depleted matrix with 60 percent or more
chroma of 2 or less and that has a minimum thickness
of either:
a. 5 cm (2 inches) if the 5 cm starts at a depth ≤10
cm (4 inches) from the soil surface, or
22 Field Indicators of
b. 15 cm (6 inches), starting at a depth ≤25 cm
(10 inches) from the soil surface.
User Notes: A depleted matrix requires a value
of 4 or more and chroma of 2 or less (fig. 29). Redox
concentrations, including soft iron-manganese
masses and/or pore linings, are required in soils
with matrix colors of 4/1, 4/2, or 5/2. A, E, and calcic
horizons may have low chromas and high values
and may therefore be mistaken for a depleted matrix;
however, they are excluded from the concept of
depleted matrix unless the soil has common or many
distinct or prominent redox concentrations occurring
as soft masses or pore linings. The low-chroma matrix
must be the result of wetness and not a weathering or
parent material feature.
F6.—Redox Dark Surface. For use in all LRRs,
except W, X, and Y; for testing in LRRs W, X, and Y.
A layer that is at least 10 cm (4 inches) thick, starting
at a depth ≤20 cm (8 inches) from the mineral soil
surface, and has:
a. Matrix value of 3 or less and chroma of 1
or less and 2 percent or more distinct or
prominent redox concentrations occurring as
soft masses or pore linings, or
b. Matrix value of 3 or less and chroma of 2
or less and 5 percent or more distinct or
prominent redox concentrations occurring as
soft masses or pore linings.
User Notes: This is a very common indicator used
to delineate wetland soils that have a dark surface
layer. Redox concentrations in mineral soils with a
high content of organic matter and a dark surface
layer are commonly small and difficult to see (figs.
30, 31, and 32). The organic matter masks some
or all of the concentrations that may be present.
Careful examination is required to see what are
commonly brownish redox concentrations in the
darkened materials. If the soil is saturated at the time
of sampling, it may be necessary to let it dry at least
to a moist condition for redox features to become
visible. Soils that are wet because of ponding or have
a shallow, perched layer of saturation may have any
color below the dark surface. It is recommended
that delineators evaluate the hydrologic source and
examine and describe the layer below the dark
colored surface layer when applying this indicator.
F7.—Depleted Dark Surface. For use in all LRRs,
except W, X, and Y; for testing in LRRs W, X, and Y.
Redox depletions with value of 5 or more and chroma
of 2 or less in a layer that is at least 10 cm (4 inches)
thick, starting at a depth ≤20 cm (8 inches) from the
mineral soil surface, and has:
a. Matrix value of 3 or less and chroma of 1 or
less and 10 percent or more redox depletions,
or
b. Matrix value of 3 or less and chroma of 2 or
less and 20 percent or more redox depletions.
User Notes: Care should be taken not to mistake
mixing of an E or calcic horizon into the surface
layer for depletions. The “pieces” of E and calcic
horizons are not redox depletions. Knowledge of
local conditions is required in areas where E and/or
calcic horizons may be present. In soils that are wet
because of subsurface saturation, the layer directly
below the dark surface layer should have a depleted
or gleyed matrix. Redox depletions should have
associated redox concentrations (fig. 32) that occur as
Fe pore linings or masses within the depletion(s) or
surrounding the depletion(s).
23 Hydric Soils
F8.—Redox Depressions. For use in all LRRs,
except W, X, and Y; for testing in LRRs W, X, and Y.
In closed depressions subject to ponding, 5 percent
or more distinct or prominent redox concentrations
occurring as soft masses or pore linings in a layer that
is 5 cm (2 inches) or more thick and starts at a depth
≤10 cm (4 inches) from the soil surface.
User Notes: This indicator occurs on depressional
landforms, such as vernal pools, playa lakes,
rainwater basins, “Grady” ponds, and potholes (figs.
33 and 34). It does not occur in microdepressions
(approximately 1 m) on convex or plane landscapes.
24 Field Indicators of
F10.—Marl. For use in LRR K, L, and U. A layer
of marl with value of 5 or more and chroma 2 or less
starting at a depth ≤10 cm (4 inches) from the soil
surface (fig. 35).
User Notes: Marl is a limnic material deposited in
water by precipitation of CaCO3
by algae as defined
in Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 1999). It has a
Munsell value of 5 or more and reacts with dilute HCl
to evolve CO2
. Marl is not the carbonatic substrate
material associated with limestone bedrock. Some
soils have materials with all of the properties of marl,
except for the required Munsell value. These soils are
hydric if the required value is present at a depth ≤10
cm (4 inches) from the soil surface. Normally, this
indicator occurs at the soil surface.
F11.—Depleted Ochric. For use in MLRA 151 of
LRR T. A layer(s) 10 cm (4 inches) or more thick in
which 60 percent or more of the matrix has value of 4
or more and chroma of 1 or less. The layer starts at a
depth ≤15 cm (6 inches) from the soil surface.
User Notes: This indicator is applicable in deltaic
accreting areas along the Mississippi River.
F12.—Iron-Manganese Masses. For use in LRRs
N, O, P, and T; for testing in LRRs D, K, L, M, and
R. On flood plains, a layer 10 cm (4 inches) or more
thick with 40 percent or more chroma of 2 or less
and 2 percent or more distinct or prominent redox
concentrations occurring as soft iron-manganese
masses with diffuse boundaries. The layer starts at a
depth ≤20 cm (8 inches) from the soil surface. Iron-
manganese masses have value and chroma of 3 or
less. Most commonly, they are black. The thickness
requirement is waived if the layer is the mineral
surface layer.
User Notes: These iron-manganese masses
generally are small (2 to 5 mm in size) and have
value and chroma of 3 or less (fig. 36). They can be
dominated by manganese and therefore have a color
approaching black. The low matrix chroma must be
the result of wetness and not be a weathering or
parent material feature. Iron-manganese masses
25 Hydric Soils
should not be confused with the larger and redder
iron nodules associated with plinthite or with
concretions that have sharp boundaries. This
indicator occurs on flood plains along rivers, such as
the Apalachicola, Congaree, Mobile, Savannah, and
Tennessee Rivers.
F13.—Umbric Surface. For use in LRRs P, T, and
U and MLRA 122 of LRR N. A layer 25 cm (10 inches)
or more thick, starting at a depth ≤15 cm (6 inches)
from the soil surface, in which the upper 15 cm (6
inches) has value of 3 or less and chroma of 1 or less
and in which the lower 10 cm (4 inches) has the same
colors as those described above or any other color
that has chroma of 2 or less.
User Notes: The thickness requirements may be
slightly less than those for an umbric epipedon (fig. 37).
F16.—High Plains Depressions. For use in
MLRAs 72 and 73 of LRR H; for testing in other
MLRAs of LRR H. In closed depressions that are
subject to ponding, a mineral soil that has chroma of
1 or less to a depth of at least 35 cm (13.5 inches)
and a layer at least 10 cm (4 inches) thick starting
at a depth ≤25 cm (10 inches) from the mineral soil
surface that has either:
a. One percent or more redox concentrations
occurring as nodules or concretions, or
b. Redox concentrations occurring as nodules or
concretions with distinct or prominent corona.
User Notes: This indicator is applicable in closed
depressions (Food Security Act “playas”) in western
Kansas, southwestern Nebraska, eastern Colorado,
and southeastern Wyoming. It occurs in such soils
as those of the Ness and Pleasant series. The matrix
color of the 35-cm (13.5-inch) layer must have chroma
of 1 or less; chroma-2 matrix colors are excluded;
value generally is 3. The nodules and concretions are
rounded, are hard or very hard, range in size from
less than 1 mm to 3 mm, and most commonly are
black or reddish black. The corona (halos) generally
are reddish brown, strong brown, or yellowish brown.
The nodules and concretions can be removed from
the soil, and the corona will occur as coatings on
the concentration or will remain attached to the soil
matrix. Use of 10x to 15x magnification aids in the
identification of these features.
F17.—Delta Ochric. For use in MLRA 151 of LRR
T. A layer 10 cm (4 inches) or more thick in which
60 percent or more of the matrix has value of 4 or
more and chroma of 2 or less and there are no redox
concentrations. This layer starts at a depth less than
or equal to the upper 20 cm (8 inches) from the soil
surface.
User Notes: This indicator is applicable in
accreting areas of the Mississippi River Delta.
F18.—Reduced Vertic. For use in MLRA 150 of
LRR T; for testing in all LRRs with Vertisols and Vertic
intergrades. In Vertisols and Vertic intergrades, a
positive reaction to alpha-alpha-dipyridyl that:
a. Is the dominant (60 percent or more) condition
of a layer at least 10 cm (4 inches) thick
starting at a depth ≤30 cm (12 inches); or at
least 5 cm (2 inches) thick staring at a depth of
15 cm (6 inches) from the mineral or muck soil
surface,
b. Occurs for at least 7 continuous days and 28
cumulative days, and
26 Field Indicators of
c. Occurs during a normal or drier season and
month (within 16 to 84 percent of probable
precipitation).
User Notes: The time requirements for this
indicator were identified from research in MLRA 150A
in LRR T (Gulf Coast Prairies). These requirements
or slightly modified time requirements may be found
to identify wetland Vertisols and Vertic intergrades
in other parts of the Nation. These soils generally
have thick dark surface horizons, but indicators A11,
A12, and F6 commonly are not evident, possibly
because of masking of redoximorphic features by
organic carbon. The soils are a special case of the
“Problem Soils with Thick, Dark A Horizons” listed
in the Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation
Manual (Environmental Laboratory, 1987). Follow the
procedures and note the considerations in Hydric
Soils Technical Note 8, Use of alpha-alpha-Dipyridyl,
available online at http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/
portal/nrcs/main/soils/use/hydric/.
F19.—Piedmont Flood Plain Soils. For use in
MLRAs 148 and 149A of LRR S; for testing on flood
plains subject to Piedmont deposition throughout
LRRs P, S, and T. On flood plains, a mineral layer at
least 15 cm (6 inches) thick, starting at a depth ≤25
cm (10 inches) from the soil surface, with a matrix (60
percent or more of the volume) chroma of less than
4 and 20 percent or more distinct or prominent redox
concentrations occurring as soft masses or pore
linings.
User Notes: This indicator is for use or testing
on flood plains in the Mid-Atlantic and Southern
Piedmont Provinces and areas where sediments
derived from the Piedmont are being deposited
on flood plains on the Coastal Plain (fig. 38). This
indicator does not apply to stream terraces, which
are associated with a historic stream level and are
representative of an abandoned flood plain. While
these soils are found on flood plains, flooding may be
rare and groundwater is often the source of hydrology.
F20.—Anomalous Bright Loamy Soils. For use in
MLRA 149A of LRR S and MLRAs 153C and 153D of
LRR T; for testing in MLRA 153B of LRR T. Within 200
meters (656 feet) from estuarine marshes or water
and at a depth ≤1 m (3.28 feet) of mean high water, a
mineral layer at least 10 cm (4 inches) thick, starting
at a depth ≤20 cm (8 inches) from the soil surface,
with a matrix (60 percent or more of the volume)
chroma of less than 5 and 10 percent or more distinct
or prominent redox concentrations occurring as soft
masses or pore linings and/or depletions.
User Notes: These soils are expected to occur
on linear or convex landforms that are adjacent to
estuarine marshes or water (fig. 39).
F21.—Red Parent Material. For use in MLRA
127 of LRR N; MLRA 145 of LRR R; and MLRAs 147
and 148 of LRR S; for testing in all soils derived from
red parent materials. A layer derived from red parent
materials (see Glossary) that is at least 10 cm (4
inches) thick, starting at a depth ≤25 cm (10 Inches)
from the soil surface with a hue of 7.5YR or redder.
The matrix has a value and chroma greater than 2
and less than or equal to 4. The layer must contain
10 percent or more depletions and/or distinct or
prominent concentrations occurring as soft masses or
pore linings. Redox depletions should differ in color by
having:
a. A minimum difference of one value higher and
one chroma lower than the matrix, or
b. Value of 4 or more and chroma of 2 or less
(fig. 40).
User Notes: This indicator was developed for use
in areas of red parent material, such as residuum
in the Piedmont Province Triassic lowlands section
or the Paleozoic “red beds” of the Appalachian
Mountains, and in alluvium or colluvium derived from
these materials. This indicator may occur along the
Red River (Arkansas and Louisiana). In glaciated
areas, the indicator may form in glacial till, outwash,
deltaic sediments, or glaciolacustrine sediments
derived from similar parent materials in the area.
Soils potentially derived from red parent materials
should be evaluated to determine the Color Change
27 Hydric Soils
Propensity Index (CPPI) and be shown to have CCPI
values below 30 (Rabenhorst and Parikh, 2000). In
landscapes where mixing or stratification of parent
materials occur, it cannot be assumed that sediment
overlying red parent material is derived solely from
that parent material. The total percentage of all redox
concentrations and redox depletions must add up
to at least 10 percent to meet the threshold for this
indicator.
This indicator is typically found at the boundary
between hydric and non-hydric soils. Other, more
common indicators may be found on the interior (fig.
41). It may be helpful to involve a soil scientist familiar
with these soils to identify those soils that qualify for
this indicator.
F22.—Very Shallow Dark Surface. For use in
MLRA 138 and West Florida portions of MLRA 152A
of LRR T and MLRA 154 of LRR U; for testing in all
other MLRAs and LRRs. In depressions and flood
plains subject to frequent ponding and/or flooding,
one of the following must be observed:
a. If bedrock occurs between 15 cm (6 inches)
and 25 cm (10 inches) of the soil surface, a
layer at least 15 cm (6 inches) thick starting at
a depth ≤10 cm (4 inches) from the soil surface
with value 2.5 or less and chroma 1 or less,
and the remaining soil to bedrock must have
the same colors as above or any other color
that has chroma 2 or less; or
b. If bedrock occurs at a depth ≤15 cm (6
inches) from the soil surface, more than half
of the soil thickness must have value 2.5 or
less and chroma 1 or less, and the remaining
soil to bedrock must have the same color as
above or any other color that has a chroma 2
or less.
29
Test Indicators of Hydric Soils
The indicators listed under the heading “Field
Indicators of Hydric Soils” should be tested for use
in LRRs other than those listed. Other indicators for
testing are listed below. The test indicators are not to
be used for the purpose of delineating hydric soils.
Users of the indicators are encouraged to submit
descriptions of other soil morphologies that they think
are indicative of hydric soils along with supporting
data for inclusion in subsequent editions of Field
Indicators of Hydric Soils in the United States.
All Soils
TA4.—Alaska Color Change. For testing in LRRs
W, X, and Y. A mineral layer 10 cm (4 inches) or
more thick, starting at a depth ≤30 cm (12 inches)
from the surface, that has a matrix value of 4 or more
and chroma of 2 or less and that within 30 minutes
becomes redder by one or more Munsell unit in hue
and/or chroma when exposed to air.
User Notes: The soil should be at or near
saturation when examined. Care must be taken to
immediately obtain an accurate color of the soil
sample upon excavation. The colors should then be
closely examined again after several minutes. Do not
allow the sample to begin drying, as drying will result
in a color change. Care must be taken to closely
observe the colors. As always, do not obtain colors
while wearing sunglasses. Colors must be obtained in
the field under natural lighting and not under artificial
light. Also, look for the presence of other indicators.
TA5.—Alaska Alpine Swales. For testing in LRRs
W, X, and Y. On concave landforms, the presence of
a surface mineral layer 10 cm (4 inches) or more thick
having hue of 10YR or yellower, value of 2.5 or less,
and chroma of 2 or less. The dark surface layer is at
least twice as thick as the mineral surface layer of
soils in the adjacent convex micro-positions.
User Notes: Soils with this indicator occur in
concave areas where moisture accumulates. In
these areas the source of the hydrology is meltwater
from adjacent snowpacks that persist well into
the growing season. The landscape generally is a
complex microtopography of concave depressions
and adjacent convex microhighs. Soils should be
examined in both landscape positions and compared.
If both positions have a mineral surface layer of the
same color, but the dark surface layer is at least
twice as thick in the concave position, the soil in the
concave position is considered hydric. Make sure that
there is reasonable evidence of the hydrology source,
including either direct observation of the melting
snowpack or aerial imagery that shows snowpack at
that location earlier in the growing season.
TA6.—Mesic Spodic. For testing in MLRAs 144A
and 145 of LRR R and MLRA 149B of LRR S. A layer
5 cm (2 inches) or more thick, starting at a depth
≤15 cm (6 inches) from the mineral soil surface, that
has value of 3 or less and chroma of 2 or less and is
underlain by either:
a. One or more layers 8 cm (3 inches) or more
thick occurring at a depth ≤30 cm (12 inches)
from the mineral soil surface, having value and
chroma of 3 or less, and showing evidence of
spodic development; or
b. One or more layers 5 cm (2 inches) or more
thick occurring at a depth ≤30 cm (12 inches)
from the mineral soil surface, having value of 4
or more and chroma of 2 or less, and directly
underlain by a layer(s) 8 cm (3 inches) or more
thick having value and chroma of 3 or less and
showing evidence of spodic development.
User Notes: This indicator is used to identify wet
soils that have spodic materials or that meet the
definition of Spodosols. The layer that has value of 4
or more and chroma of 2 or less is typically described
as an E or Eg horizon (typically having a color pattern
referred to as stripped or partially stripped matrices).
The layers with evidence of the accumulation of
translocated organic matter typically are described
as Bh, Bhs, Bhsm, Bsm, or Bs horizons. These layers
typically have several color patterns or cementation
indicative of translocated iron, aluminum, and/or
organic matter.
30
Sandy Soils
TS7.—Barrier Islands Low Chroma Matrix. For
testing in MLRA 153B and 153D of LRR T. In the
swale portion of the swale-and-dune complexes of
barrier islands, a surface layer 1 cm (0.5 inches) or
more thick with value 4 or less and chroma 2 or less.
Below the dark surface, one or more layers 10 cm (4
inches) or more thick occurs with a dominant hue of
2.5Y or yellower and value 4 or more and chroma less
than 2 starting at a depth ≤15 cm (6 inches) from the
soil surface.
User Notes: The requirement of a dark surface
layer above the low chroma layer excludes sediments
from recent depositional events (especially common
in overwash areas) which are not hydric. Low chroma
colors in recent deposits are likely due to the nature of
the parent material and not related to hydrology. There
is no color requirement for any layer(s) between the
dark surface and the low chroma matrix. This indicator
is limited to sandy soils in dune-and-swale complexes
of barrier islands.
Loamy and Clayey Soils
As of this printing, no test indicators are approved
for loamy and clayey soils. To propose a new test
indicator, contact the National Technical Committee
for Hydric Soils.

or from the soil profile (figs. 42 and 43). The
hydrology may also be modified by levees and
dams, which keep water from entering a site.
CaCO3
equivalent. The acid neutralizing capacity of a
soil expressed as a weight percentage of CaCO3
(molecular weight of CaCO3
equals 100).
Calcic horizon. An illuvial horizon in which
carbonates have accumulated to a significant
extent. See Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff,
1999) for a complete definition.
Calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate has the
chemical formula of CaCO3
. It effervesces when
treated with cold hydrochloric acid.
Closed depressions. Low-lying areas that are
surrounded by higher ground and have no natural
outlet for surface drainage.
COE. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

redox depletions, or both, “common” represents 2
to 20 percent of the observed surface.
Concave landscapes. Landscapes in which the
surface curves downward.
34 Field Indicators of
*Depleted matrix. For loamy and clayey material (and
sandy material in areas of indicators A11 and
A12), a depleted matrix refers to the volume of a
soil horizon or subhorizon in which the processes
of reduction and translocation have removed or
transformed iron, creating colors of low chroma
and high value (fig. 44). A, E, and calcic horizons
may have low chromas and high values and
may therefore be mistaken for a depleted matrix;
however, they are excluded from the concept of
depleted matrix unless the soil has common or
many distinct or prominent redox concentrations
occurring as soft masses or pore linings. In
some areas the depleted matrix may change
color upon exposure to air (see Reduced matrix);
this phenomenon is included in the concept of
depleted matrix. The following combinations of
value and chroma identify a depleted matrix:
1. Matrix value of 5 or more and chroma of 1
or less with or without redox concentrations
occurring as soft masses and/or pore linings; or
2. Matrix value of 6 or more and chroma of 2
or less with or without redox concentrations
occurring as soft masses and/or pore linings; or
3. Matrix value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 and 2
percent or more distinct or prominent redox
concentrations occurring as soft masses and/or
pore linings; or
4. Matrix value of 4 and chroma of 1 and 2
percent or more distinct or prominent redox
concentrations occurring as soft masses and/or
pore linings (fig. 45).
Diffuse boundary. Used to describe redoximorphic
features that grade gradually from one color to
another (fig. 46). The color grade is commonly
more than 2 mm wide. “Clear” is used to describe
boundary color gradations intermediate between
sharp and diffuse.
With or without redox
concentrations
2% or more distinct
or prominent redox
concentrations

Distinct. Readily seen but contrasting only
moderately with the color to which compared. The
contrast is distinct if:
1. Delta hue = 0, then
a) Delta value <2 and delta chroma >1 to <4, or
b) Delta value >2 to <4 and delta chroma <4.
2. Delta hue = 1, then
a) Delta value <1 and delta chroma >1 to <3, or
b) Delta value >1 to <3 and delta chroma <3.
3. Delta hue = 2, then
a) Delta value = 0 and delta chroma >0 to <2,
or
b) Delta value >0 to <2 and delta chroma <2.
Regardless of the magnitude of hue difference,
where both colors have value <3 and chroma
<2, the contrast is faint.
E horizon. A mineral horizon in which the dominant
process is loss of silicate clay, iron, and/or
aluminum, leaving a concentration of sand and silt
particles (fig. 47). See Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey
Staff, 1999) for a complete definition.
EPA. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Epipedon. A horizon that has developed at the soil
surface. See Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff,
1999) for a complete definition.
Faint. Evident only on close examination. The contrast
is faint if:
1. Delta hue = 0, then delta value ≤2 and delta
chroma ≤1, or
2. Delta hue = 1, then delta value ≤1 and delta
chroma ≤1, or
3. Delta hue = 2, then delta value = 0 and delta
chroma = 0, or

Any feature above the upper threshold for faint
features would be considered either distinct or
prominent. If an indicator requires distinct or
prominent features then those features at or
below the faint threshold do not count.
Fe-Mn concretions. Firm to extremely firm,
irregularly shaped bodies with sharp to diffuse
boundaries. When broken in half, concretions
have concentric layers. See Vepraskas (1994) for
a complete discussion.
Fe-Mn nodules. Firm to extremely firm, irregularly
shaped bodies with sharp to diffuse boundaries.
When broken in half, nodules do not have visibly
organized internal structure. See Vepraskas
(1994) for a complete discussion.
Few. When referring to redox concentrations, redox
depletions, or both, “few” represents less than 2
percent of the observed surface.
Fibric. See Peat.
Flood plain. The nearly level plain that borders a
stream and is subject to inundation under flood-
stage conditions unless protected artificially. It is
usually a constructional landform built of sediment
deposited during overflow and lateral migration of
the stream.
Fragmental soil material. Soil material that consists
of 90 percent or more rock fragments. Less than
10 percent of the soil consists of particles 2 mm
or smaller.
Frequently flooded or ponded. A frequency class in
which flooding or ponding is likely to occur often
under usual weather conditions (a chance of more
than 50 percent in any year, or more than 50
times in 100 years).
FWS. U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and
Wildlife Service.
*g. A horizon suffix indicating that the horizon is gray
because of wetness but not necessarily that it is
gleyed. All gleyed matrices (defined below) should
have the suffix “g”; however, not all horizons with
the “g” suffix are gleyed. For example, a horizon
with the color 10YR 6/2 that is at least seasonally
wet, with or without other redoximorphic features,
should have the “g” suffix.
Glauconitic. Refers to a mineral aggregate that
contains a micaceous mineral resulting in a
characteristic green color, e.g., glauconitic shale
or clay (fig. 49).
*Gleyed matrix. Soils with a gleyed matrix have the
following combinations of hue, value, and chroma
(the soils are not glauconitic):
1. 10Y, 5GY, 10GY, 10G, 5BG, 10BG, 5B, 10B, or
5PB with value of 4 or more and chroma of 1;
or
2. 5G with value of 4 or more and chroma of 1 or
2; or
3. N with value of 4 or more; or
In some places the gleyed matrix may change
color upon exposure to air. (See Reduced matrix).
This phenomenon is included in the concept of
gleyed matrix (figs. 50 and 51).
*Hemic. See Mucky peat.

etc. that indicates a difference in material from
which the horizons formed.
LRR. Land resource region. LRRs are geographic
areas characterized by a particular pattern
of soils, climate, water resources, and land
use. Each LRR is assigned a different letter of
the alphabet (A-Z). LRRs are defined in U.S.

NRCS, 2006b).
Many. When referring to redox concentrations, redox
depletions, or both, “many” represents more than
20 percent of the observed surface.

definition.
*Masked. Through redoximorphic processes, the
color of soil particles is hidden by organic
material, silicate clay, iron, aluminum, or some
combination of these.
Matrix. The dominant soil volume that is continuous
in appearance. When three colors occur, such as
when a matrix, depletions, and concentrations are
present, the matrix may represent less than 50
percent of the total soil volume.
MLRA. Major land resource areas. MLRAs are
geographically associated divisions of land
resource regions. MLRAs are defined in U.S.

*Mucky modified mineral soil material. A USDA soil
texture modifier, e.g., mucky sand. Mucky modified
mineral soil material that has 0 percent clay has

clay has between 12 and 18 percent organic
carbon. Soils with an intermediate amount of clay
have intermediate amounts of organic carbon.
Where the organic component is peat (fibric

does not meet the fiber content (after rubbing)
or sodium pyrophosphate solution extract color
requirements for either peat (fibric) or muck
(sapric) soil material.

Change Propensity Index (CCPI) of <30
(Rabenhorst and Parikh, 2000). Most commonly,
the material consists of dark red, consolidated
Mesozoic or Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, such
as shale, siltstone, and sandstone, or alluvial
materials derived from such rocks. Assistance
from a local soil scientist may be needed to
determine where red parent material occurs.
Redox concentrations. Bodies of apparent
accumulation of Fe-Mn oxides (figs. 54 and
55). Redox concentrations include soft masses,
pore linings, nodules, and concretions. For
the purposes of the indicators, nodules and
concretions are excluded from the concept of
redox concentrations unless otherwise specified
by specific indicators. See Vepraskas (1994) for a
complete discussion.
Redox depletions. Bodies of low chroma (2 or less)
having value of 4 or more where Fe-Mn oxides
have been stripped or where both Fe-Mn oxides

discussion.
Redoximorphic features. Features formed by the
processes of reduction, translocation, and/or
oxidation of Fe and Mn oxides (figs. 54 and 55);
formerly called mottles and low-chroma colors.

Reduced matrix. A soil matrix that has low chroma
and high value, but in which the color changes
in hue or chroma when the soil is exposed to air.
See Vepraskas (1994) for a complete discussion.
*Reduction. For the purpose of the indicators,
reduction occurs when the redox potential (Eh) is
below the ferric-ferrous iron threshold as adjusted
for pH. In hydric soils, this is the point when the
transformation of ferric iron (Fe3+
) to ferrous iron
(Fe2+
) occurs.
Relict features. Soil morphological features that
reflect past hydrologic conditions of saturation
and anaerobiosis. See Vepraskas (1994) for a
complete discussion.
*Sapric. See Muck.
Saturation. Wetness characterized by zero or positive
pressure of the soil water. Almost all of the soil
pores are filled with water.

sand, silt, and clay particles in the soil material
less than 2 mm in size.
Spodic horizon. A mineral soil horizon that is
characterized by the illuvial accumulation of
amorphous materials consisting of aluminum
41 Hydric Soils
and organic carbon with or without iron (figs.

thickness, a minimum quantity of oxalate
extractable carbon plus aluminum, and/or specific
color requirements.
Stream terrace. Flat-topped landforms in a stream
valley that flank and are parallel to the stream
channel, originally formed by previous stream
level, and representing the abandoned flood plain,
stream bed, or valley floor produced during a past
state of fluvial erosion or deposition (i.e., currently
very rarely or never flooded; inactive cut and fill
and/or scour and fill processes). Stream terraces
may occur singularly or as a series. Erosional
surfaces cut into bedrock and thinly mantled
with stream deposits (alluvium) are called “strath
terraces.” Remnants of constructional valley floors
thickly mantled with alluvium are called “alluvial
terraces.”
Umbric epipedon. A thick, dark mineral surface
horizon with base saturation of less than 50
percent. See Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff,
1999) for a complete definition.
Vertisol. A mineral soil with 30 percent or more clay
in all layers. These soils expand and shrink,
depending on moisture content, and have
slickensides or wedge-shaped peds. See Soil
Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 1999) for a complete
definition.

Accessibility Statement
The U.S. Department of Agriculture is committed to making its electronic and
information technologies accessible to individuals with disabilities by meeting or
exceeding the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794d),
as amended in 1998. Section 508 is a federal law that requires agencies to provide
individuals with disabilities equal access to electronic information and data comparable
to those who do not have disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on
the agency. The Section 508 standards are the technical requirements and criteria that
are used to measure conformance within this law. More information on Section 508
and the technical standards can be found at www.section508.gov.
