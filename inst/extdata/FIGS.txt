Figure 1. The soil on the right is hydric. It meets the requirements of indicator S7 (Dark Surface). From the surface and to a depth
of 10 cm, value is 3 or less and chroma is 1 or less. Below 10 cm, the matrix has chroma of 2 or less.The soil on the left is
not hydric. It does not have a dark surface layer thick enough to meet the requirements of indicator S7 and does not meet the
requirements of any other indicator.

Figure 2. The soil profile above consists of an 8 cm (3.14
inches) layer of peat and/or mucky peat underlain by
a 1 cm (0.4 inches) layer of muck.The remaining soil
layers are sandy soil material. In LRRs R, W, X, and
Y, observations would begin below the peat, mucky
peat, and muck layers (9 cm). In LRRs, F, G, H, and M,
observations would start at the actual soil surface. In all
remaining LRRs, observations would begin at the muck
surface (8 cm).

Figure 3. The left portion of this ped shows moist soil colors,
and the right portion shows dry soil colors. Moist colors
are to be used when hydric soils are identified. The moist
colors in this picture would meet the requirements for
indicator F6 (Redox Dark Surface), but the dry colors
would not meet these requirements.
—
Figure 4. The lower portion of this soil profile meets the
color and depth requirements of indicator F3 (Depleted
Matrix); however, the upper portion of the profile contains
a layer with chroma of 2 or more that is more than 15 cm
(6 inches) thick. As a result, indicator F3 (Depleted Matrix)
is not met.

as described in the Hydric Soil Technical Standard is

than 40 cm (16 inches) of organic material, starting at the
soil surface
—
Figure 8. Indicators A2 (Histic Epipedon) and A3 (Black
Histic).This soil meets the depth criterion of A2 and
the color and depth criteria of A3.The black color, a
requirement of A3, results from the accumulation of
organic matter when the soil is saturated and anaerobic.

This soil also meets the requirements of indicator A6
(Organic Bodies).
—
Figure 11. Indicator A6 (Organic Bodies). An individual
organic body generally is about 1 to 3 cm in size.
—
Figure 12. Indicator A6 (Organic Bodies). Some organic
bodies are smaller than 1 cm.

Figure 13. Indicator A7 (5 cm Mucky Mineral). This soil has
more than 5 cm of mucky sand, starting at the surface.
—
Figure 14. Indicator A9 (1 cm Muck). This soil has more than
1 cm of muck, starting at 8 cm on the left measuring
tape. Different LRRs may use the presence of muck or 2
cm of muck as an indicator of a hydric soil.
—
Figure 15. Indicator A11 (Depleted Below Dark Surface).
This soil has a thin dark surface horizon that meets the
requirements of indicator A11. Because a depleted matrix
below the surface horizon starts at a depth of ≤15 cm from
the soil surface and is at least 5 cm thick, the soil also
meets the requirements of indicator F3 (Depleted Matrix).
—
Figure 16. Indicator A11 (Depleted Below Dark Surface).
This soil has a thick dark surface horizon that meets the
requirements of indicator A11. Unlike the matrix in figure
15, the depleted matrix below the dark surface horizon
in this soil starts at a depth of about 29 cm, which is too
deep to meet the requirements of indicator F3 (Depleted
Matrix). Indicator A11 allows a deeper depleted matrix
than indicator F3.
—
Figure 17. Indicator A12 (Thick Dark Surface). Deep
observation is needed to determine whether a soil meets
the requirements of this indicator. In this soil, depth to the
depleted matrix is about 55 cm.
—
Figure 18. Indicator A13 (Alaska Gleyed). The bluish band at
a depth of about 20 cm indicates the presence of reduced
soil material.The material below 20 cm reflects both the
color of the parent material and soil weathering under
aerobic conditions.

Figure 19. Indicator A14 (Alaska Redox). The matrix color
meets the requirements of a gleyed matrix. Reddish
orange redox concentrations occur along the pores and
channels of living roots.

are along root channels. Reduction occurs first along root
channels, where organic carbon is concentrated.

requirements of indicator S5, having a matrix chroma
of 2 or less and at least 2 percent redox concentrations
starting at a depth of about 10 cm.

requires diffuse splotchy patterns with rounded areas
stripped of organic matter or iron, as exemplified in this
photo.
—
Figure 25. Indicator S7 (Dark Surface). This soil has value of
3 or less and chroma of 1 or less from the surface to a
depth of 10 cm. Directly below 10 cm, it is the same color,
meeting the requirement of having chroma of 2 or less.
—
Figure 26. Indicator S8 (Polyvalue Below Surface). The diffuse
splotchy pattern of black (value of 3 or less and chroma of
1 or less) and gray (value of 4 or more and chroma of 1 or
less) below a black surface horizon is evidence of organic
matter that has been mobilized and translocated.This
soil also meets the requirements of indicator S5 (Sandy
Redox).
—
Figure 27. Indicator S9 (Thin Dark Surface). A dark surface
horizon about 5 cm thick overlies a thin layer with value
of 4 or less and chroma of 1 or less. Directly below the
second layer is a spodic horizon, starting at a depth of
about 7 cm.
—
Figure 28. Indicator F2 (Loamy Gleyed Matrix). The gleyed
matrix begins at the surface and extends to a depth of
about 14 cm.
—
Figure 29. Indicator F3 (Depleted Matrix).This soil has
value of 4 or more and chroma of 2 or less and redox
concentrations starting at a depth of 8 cm. Since the
depleted matrix starts at a depth of ≤15 cm from the soil
surface, the minimum thickness requirement is only 5 cm.
—
Figure 30. Indicator F6 (Redox Dark Surface). A soil that
meets the requirements of indicator F6 must have a dark
surface layer with value of 3 or less and chroma of 2 or
less and redox concentrations in the dark layer.
—
Figure 31. Indicators F6 (Redox Dark Surface) and
F7 (Depleted Dark Surface). A soil that meets the
requirements of indicator F7 commonly also meets the
requirements of indicator F6. If the dark surface layer
has depletions, it most likely also has concentrations.

(Depleted Dark Surface). An example of both depletions
and concentrations in a dark matrix.

requires only 5 percent redox concentrations in the upper
part of the soil.The matrix does not have chroma of 2 or
less.

requires that the soil be in a closed depression subject to
ponding.This soil is in a backwater depression on a flood
plain.

depth ≤10 cm of the soil surface.The scale is in cm.
Figure 36. Indicator F12 (Iron-Manganese Masses). Although
this indicator requires only 40 percent value of chroma
of 2 or less, at least 2 percent iron-manganese masses is
needed.These masses are indicated by black splotches in
this photo.
—
Figure 37. Indicator F13 (Umbric Surface).This soil has
an umbric surface horizon about 44 cm thick. It meets
the requirements not only of indicator F13 but also of
indicators A7 (5 cm Mucky Mineral) and A12 (Thick Dark
Surface).

indicator is restricted to active flood plains. It does not
require a matrix color with chroma of 2 or less.

marshes or water. It does not require a matrix color with
chroma of 2 or less.

should be used only in areas of red parent material that
is resistant to reduction. Not all red soils formed in red
parent material.

adjacent to a ditch.The profile on the left is from an
area not affected by the ditch. Both soils meet the
requirements for indicators F3 (Depleted Matrix) and A11
(Depleted Below Dark Surface) and thus are hydric soils.

Figure 49. Glauconitic soils typically have gleyed, green,
or black matrices and can have mottles of weathered

would appear to meet the requirements of indicator F6
(Redox Dark Surface).
